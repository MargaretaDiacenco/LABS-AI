## General info
This is a laboratory work for an AI course. Tha task was to create a rule-based exepert system that could answer which creature the user is looking at, based on a set of characteristics.

## Technologies
* VS Code - version 1.53.2
* Python - version 3.9.1

## Setup
Install the latest VS Code version available, as well as the latest version of Python. Run the code in the lab.py file by clicking on the *Run* button on the VS Code IDE or running the following command:

`python lab1.py`

*Note:* if you have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer, run the following command, in order to avoid any trouble:

`python3 lab1.py`  

## Features
* Creatures inspired by the Gravity Falls cartoon, with accurate characteristics.
* Polite interaction with the user.

## To-do list:
* Make possible to input any numbers as characteristics.
* Make system unable to confuse between the same characteristic value, but in different characteristic, e.g. if there are multiple characteristics with the value "none".

## Status
The project is _in progress_.

## Inspiration
My colleague Anastasia Ivanova.
